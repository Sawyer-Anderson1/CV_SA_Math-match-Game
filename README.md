Topic

The topic for the term project this semester is the Math-match game, option “Multiply Easy”. 

For a feel of the game visit:

https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/math-match-game.html, then choose the option “Multiply Easy”.

Note: MARS does not have a graphic capability, so ASCII characters-based board is sufficient.

Minimum requirements for the program:

The game is for one player. The program provides the game environment for the user.
The game board is displayed using ASCII characters (e.g. , -, +, and |) is the minimum requirement. Creative ways to display the board, e.g. with graphics, will earn extra credits.
Extra credits will be given for:

Graphic (10 pts) and sound (5pts)
These extra credit features MUST be documented in your report and explained well to unlock these extra credits.

IMPORTANT: The program must be developed as multiple modules (i.e. multiple .asm files), each module implements one part of the game. If the program is implemented as one file points will be severely deducted. 


Submission Requirements:

At the end of the semester by the due date, EACH student must submit a ZIP file containing

1. A project report (in Word format) covering

   a) a description of the program,

   b) the challenges that you and your partner had and how did the team overcome them,

   c) what you have learned by doing the project,

   d) a discussion of algorithms and techniques used in the program, e.g. how to display the board, how to check and remember a move from the user? How does the program work?

   e) contributions of your partner (peer evaluation), 

   f) any suggestions you may have (optional).

Make sure that you write what you have learned by doing this project and peer evaluation parts individually.

2. A short video clip demonstrating the program in action. (If the video is too big you can post it on a website, e.g. YouTube, and submit the link). The video should have audio narration explaining the behavior of your program.

3. All MIPS assembly language modules that are needed to run your program in a folder.

4. A user manual on how to run and how to use the program.

Obviously, items 2. 3 and 4. are the same for you and your partner, but item 1 must be prepared by each of you individually (some sections of the report, e.g. a) and d), can be shared).

How will points be given?

First, the implementation and documentation of the program will be graded based on the requirements listed above. 70% of the grade will be assigned to the program implementation and 30% will be assigned to the documentation.
Then the peer evaluation section of the project report (section e) will be taken into consideration when assigning points to each student. If your partner reported that you did not contribute to the project, you may get ZERO point for this assignment 
You should find a partner and get together as soon as possible to discuss the requirements and decide on how to break down the task to assign to each student. Feel free to contact the instructor if more information is needed.

Happy coding!
